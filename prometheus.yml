# Prometheus configuration for tracking SwiftRelay service.
# For development and testing purposes only, don't use in production without proper setup.

global:
  scrape_interval: 5s # Scrape every 5 seconds

# Note: Target configuration depends on your deployment environment:
# - For local development: Use "host.docker.internal:8000" to access the service running on your host machine
# - For Docker deployment: Use "swiftrelay-api:8000" to access the service within the Docker network
#   Make sure to replace "swiftrelay-api" and "8000" with your actual docker container name and port if different
#   Also check that you have the swiftrelay container inside "swiftrelay_network".

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'swiftrelay-api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:8000'] # Scrape from the /metrics endpoint
